# Pomodoro-Timer-App
The Pomodoro technique is a time-management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

This app uses React State and rendering and has interactive components that allow the user to change and set up focus and break intervals. Audio plays when the focus timer and break timer expires, respectively. All states are updated using callbacks to avoid race conditions. Each component has a single responsibility.
